Dear All,

I am trying to build wxWidgets on Iphone simulator through "wxWidget
\build\osx\wxiphone_in.xcodeproj" downloaded from
http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk.

the project is opening but there is no wxWidgets source code available
nor any build button enable in xcode IDE.

Is this xcode project is breaking or I am missing something.I followed
following steps to build it for IPhone simulator.

1. check out the  wxWidgets code from the following SVN repository.
http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk

2.  In the checked out code iPhone project is available. the iphone
project file is  "wxWidget\build\osx\wxiphone_in.xcodeproj".

3. Use this project and build the wxWidgets source code using iPhone
SDK.

Kindly help me in this.

Regards,
Gaurav Verma
